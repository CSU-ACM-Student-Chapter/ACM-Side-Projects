# ACM Side Projects

## Description
This is a repo for all of our fun public projects. Members can push their projects to this page to share with the rest of the club.

### Purpose
Share personal projects for inspiration, feedback, education, and gaining an audience

### How it works
Students may create a PR (pull request) for a directory containing their project, or a file contaiining a link to where their project is hosted on their account - preferably a github account.
<br>- In the case of a file with a link, use of an MD file for markup is recommended, with a description alongside your link.
<br>- In the case of file or directory, students should add an MD file describing what they would like with sharing their project - feedback, help, just sharing, etc.

## Current Projects
